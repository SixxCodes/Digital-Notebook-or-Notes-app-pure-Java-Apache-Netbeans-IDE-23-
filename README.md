# ðŸŒ± ThoughtNest ðŸŒ±
* A Digital Notebook or Notes app made using pure Java on Apache Netbeans IDE 23.
* School purposes only.
* This was for our final project on Data Structures and Algorithms subject. 1st Year College 2nd Semester 2nd Term.

## ðŸŒ± Paths:
1. src/thoughtnest_maingui for the codes.
2. src/thoughtnest_images for the images.
3. userData.txt for storing user datas (used hashmap for this).

### ðŸŒ± Note:
If I can, I also want to turn this project, ThoughtNest, into a mobile or android application so I could practice some more. If I also can, I want to put it on playstore. Maybe I'll use Dart on Android Studios, or still Java.
